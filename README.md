I made this turntable for my favorite board game, Dominion by Donald X. Vaccarino.
To start, I cadded the turntable in Onshape.
I then CAMed the turntable in Fusion 360.
Finally, I used my Shapeoko 4 XXL CNC machine to manufacture it out of .75in Plywood.
After that, I stained the board using a water based stain/polyeurathane combo for water resistance.
I then screwed it into a 12in bearing I purchased online, for a fun game night :)
